## Presentation
**Note : StreamSmart is a recommendation-based application developed during the second year of studies at ENSAI. It guides users in selecting the most suitable streaming service subscriptions based on their cinematic preferences and budget. The project applies structured development practices, with integration of external APIs and a PostgreSQL database.**


This project aims to develop a tool to give you the best Provider for a watchlist of films based on your film's tastes.

## Main Features

- **User Account Management:**
  - Create, authenticate, and manage user accounts.
  - Secure password management with hashing and salt.
  
- **Film Search & Discovery:**
  - Search for films by title.
  - View detailed film information, including:
    - Descriptions
    - Release dates
    - Genres
    - Streaming platforms

- **Watchlist Management:**
  - Create and manage personalized watchlists.
  - Add or remove films in a watchlist.

- **Subscription Recommendation:**
  - Suggest optimal streaming subscriptions based on:
    - Price
    - Quality (e.g., HD, 4K)
    - Advertisement presence

- **Advanced Features:**
  - Support for tiered subscriptions (e.g., HD, 4K resolutions).
  - Exploration of niche subscription types (e.g., sports content).

## :computer: Installation

### Clone the Project

1. Open **Git Bash** or a terminal

2. Create a project folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p <folder_path> && cd $_
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/gpmp58/StreamSmartGroupe11.git
   ```

### Configure Environment

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <folder_path>
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Rename `.env.template` to `.env`
   - Fill in your personal information instead of **xxxx**. Example:
     ```env
     Get your API KEY here :
     "https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/authentication"

     API_KEY="XXXX"
     POSTGRES_HOST=sgbd-eleves.domensai.ecole
     POSTGRES_PORT=5432
     POSTGRES_DATABASE=idxxxx
     POSTGRES_USER=idxxxx
     POSTGRES_PASSWORD=idxxxx
     POSTGRES_SCHEMA=projet
     ```

## How to run the App

After opening the project, in the terminal , run the following instruction :

1. **Initialize the database**:
   - Run the initialization script:
     ```bash
     python src/utils/reset_database.py
     ```
   - This will create the necessary tables and import base data

2. **Run the app**:
```
python start_application.py

```

By running this script you do these 4 steps :

- Installing the newer version of pip
- Installing all the requirements from requirements.txt
- Launching the webservice
- Launching the App
